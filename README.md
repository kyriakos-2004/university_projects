# 🎓 University Programming Exercises

Welcome to my collection of programming exercises completed during my second year of studies.

## 📂 About This Repository

This repository includes various assignments and exercises given as part of university coursework. The projects cover topics such as:

- Object-oriented programming  
- File handling and persistence  
- Multithreading and concurrency  
- UNIX signals
- Socket programming in UNIX

## ⚠️ Project Status

The projects in this repository are **incomplete** or **partially implemented**, as the primary goal was to explore and understand key programming concepts rather than to deliver fully polished applications.

I might revisit and improve these projects in the future
