## üìã Lab Description

This project is a simple **calculator implemented in MIPS32 Assembly**.
It performs basic arithmetic operations between two float numbers.

**Objective:**  
Create a calculator in MIPS32 Assembly that can perform the following operations:

- Addition (+)  
- Subtraction (-)  
- Multiplication (*)  
- Division (/)  
- Modulus (%)

**Program Requirements:**

1. Prompt the user to input two integers (no input validation required).
2. Ask for a single operation symbol (+, -, *, /, %).
3. Perform the operation on the inputs.
4. Display the result.
5. Ask the user whether they want to perform another calculation.
6. If division or modulus is selected, check for division by zero and display an error message if needed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- **Important**: The current Assembly code does not strictly follow clean coding practices or programming standards.
- It was written as part of a lab exercise and prioritizes functionality over style or optimization.
- I might revisit and improve the code in the future for better readability, maintainability, and performance.
